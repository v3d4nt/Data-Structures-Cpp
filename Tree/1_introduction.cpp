/*
    Notes:-
    Hierarchical data structure.
    Non-linear DS
    one of the most powerful and advanced DS

    Terminologies:-
    Root, parent, child node, sibling, path, height of node, height of tree, depth of node, degree of node, edge

    Advantages:-
    reflects structural relationship
    used to represents hierarchy
    efficient insertion and searching operations
    trees are flexible, allow to move subtrees around with min effort

    depth is calculated downward, height is calculated upward (ALWAYS)
    degree of node in tree is the "No. of children" eg. degree of leaf node is always 0
