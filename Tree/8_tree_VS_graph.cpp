/*
    TREE:
        1. one path exist b/w two vertices
        2. root node is starting 
        3. doesnt have loops
        4. no of edges = no of nodes - 1
        5. heirarchical 
        6. all trees are graph

    GRAPH:
        1. more than one paths may exist b/w two vertices
        2. no root node concept
        3. can have loops
        4. no formula to find edges
        5. looks like network
        6. not all graph are tree
